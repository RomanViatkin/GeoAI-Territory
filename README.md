# GeoAI-Territory

An open-source demonstration of how modern territorial development can integrate GIS, UAV data, and generative AI for better spatial decision-making.

## 🔍 Project Scope

This repository showcases a simulated community development model that includes:

- UAV-based photogrammetry and data collection
- Integration of GIS cadastral layers
- Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting spatial data
- Predictive modeling for land use, environmental pressure, and zoning

## 📁 Structure

- `data/`: sample spatial data files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for spatial analysis and AI modeling
- `ai_models/`: prompt examples and small scripts using LLMs
- `drone_photogrammetry/`: examples of drone-captured imagery and DEM processing
- `docs/`: case study documentation

## 🤖 Technologies

- Python, GeoPandas, QGIS, Leaflet, GPT-4
- UAV Imagery (processed using WebODM)
- OpenAI for natural language-driven spatial interpretation
